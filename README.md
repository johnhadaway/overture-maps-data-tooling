To-do: 
* Update the existing SELECT queries (for the places themes and the two subtypes of the admins theme) --> the values that are saved are JSON-like --> factor them out into seperate columns and assume, where necessary, that the first item in the list is sufficient
* Add the other SELECT queries to config.json
